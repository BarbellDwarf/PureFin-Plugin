   - Whisper integration needed
   - Word-level timestamp alignment required

3. **Basic Scene Detection**: Simple FFmpeg integration
   - Needs enhancement with I-frames
   - Keyframe sampling not implemented

4. **No External Data**: MovieContentFilter not integrated
   - API client needs to be built
   - Data merging logic required

5. **Limited Testing**: No automated test suite

  - Can migrate to SQLite if needed

- **Polling vs Events**: Using 500ms polling for playback
  - More reliable across clients
  - Acceptable performance impact

- **Mock Models**: Allows end-to-end testing
  - Real models are drop-in replacement
  - No plugin code changes needed

## Resources Needed

### For Full Implementation

1. **AI Models**:
   - NSFW.js pre-trained model
   - Violence detection model (custom or pre-trained)
   - Whisper model for audio (base or small)

2. **Development Time**:
   - Real model integration: 2-3 weeks
   - Audio profanity detection: 1-2 weeks
   - External data integration: 1-2 weeks
   - Automated testing: 1-2 weeks
   - Per-user profiles: 1 week

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - GPU recommended for model training/testing
   - Model storage (10-100GB depending on models)
